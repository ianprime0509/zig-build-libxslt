# zig-build-libxslt

Similar to [zig-build-libxml2](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-build-libxml2),
but for [libxslt](http://www.xmlsoft.org/libxslt/index.html).

Currently nothing more than a POC to get xsltproc to build. It has several
problems hindering general library use (see the many TODOs).
